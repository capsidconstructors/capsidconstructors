				<h3>Jake Silove</h3>
				<p>Jake is a third-year Advanced Science/Law student majoring in Physics. He has applied a mathematical formalism to the biological process that the team is investigating</p>
				<p>He hopes to one day tackle the world's greatest issues using his interdisciplinary Legal and Scientific Background.</p>
				<h3>Lucien Alperstein</h3>
				<p>Lucien is in his final year of an Advanced Science degree in microbiology, and already has a degree in Communications</p>
				<p>He is now extremely interested in environmental microbiology. He hopes to synthesise bioinformatic approaches with field research, to understand how microbes and macro-organisms live in various obligate states of symbiosis.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4">
				<h3>Maddie Wainwright</h3>
				<p>Maddie is a third-year Advanced Science/Law student with a major in molecular and cell biology.</p>
				<p>She is passionate about synthetic biology because of its endless potential, and hopes to research novel solutions to environmental problems.</p>
				<p>She is also interested in the legalities of biotechnology in Australia, and how effective policy can foster new scientific discoveries.</p>
				<img id="team" class="img-fluid" src="images/team.png" />
				<h3>Thilina De Silva</h3>
				<p>Thil is in his fourth year of a Chemical and Biomedical Engineering degree.</p>
				<p>After completing a biomedical research scholarship, he aspires to continue exploring the biomedical world in hopes of treading undiscovered ground.</p>
				<p>Synthesising unique ideas and using entrepreneurial and technical skills is what excites him to work in the team and contribute to this project.
				</p>

			<div class="col-md-4 gutter">
				<h3>Hugh Allison</h3>
				<p>Hugh is in his final year of a degree in Chemical Engineering (and is looking for a good graduate position!).</p>
				<p>He has used his background to derive a systematic approach to the challenges of BIOMOD.</p>
				<p>He likes to think that though this sort of work is on a smaller scale than more traditional applications of engineering, the applications are potentially much greater.</p>
				<h3>Brian Ee</h3>
				<p>Brian is a third year Advanced Science/Arts student, majoring in microbiology and music.</p>
				<p>A school project on the history of penicillin discovery inspired a love for science and all things microbial, and Brian has been hooked ever since.</p>
				<p>Synthetic biology excites Brian, as he enjoys exploring new ideas and coming up with creative solutions.</p>

				<h3>Supervision</h3>
				<p>The team have been graciously mentored by the <a href="https://sms.unsw.edu.au/lawrence-lee">Lee Lab</a> at the EMBL Australia Node for Single Molecule Science, School of Medical Sciences, UNSW Sydney.</p>
				<p>Lawrence, Sophie, Rokiah, Steph, Andy, Chu Wai, Boaz, Abi and Jon - your patient guidance and well placed criticisms are invisible here, but all the same they are a critical part of our finished product. We can&#8217;t say enough about all you have done for us, thankyou!</p>
				<p>We would also like to acknowledge Dr Derrick Lau (UNSW Sydney) and Dr David Jacques (UTS Sydney) for their contributions and assistance with the protein engineering segment of our project.</p>
