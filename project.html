				<p>Self-assembly is a fundamental principle governing the coordination of component parts to synthesise biological systems. Individual subunits are only able to interact with their immediate neighbours, and yet form complex systems capable of performing emergent functions. We observe self-assembly in nature at every scale including with biomolecules. And yet, for a principle so entwined with the very existence of life, we know very little about it.</p>

				<p>The HIV capsid is one such self-assembling system. The capsid acts as a protein shield, surrounding the viral RNA within. Whilst the three-dimensional fullerene cone looks complicated in structure, it is in fact made up of a single protein; HIV-1 capsid proteins. Thousands of CA proteins interact on the molecular level, first forming hexamer and pentamers, and then assembling into the HIV capsid.</p>

				<p>Individual protein units must contain encoded information leading to the self-assembly of the capsid structure. This information may relate to the interaction between proteins, conformational changes that occur during the self-assembly system, reaction to changes in environmental conditions. However, given that our proteins are a mere 26.6kDa, conventional measuring technologies are insufficient. Instead, we needed to develop innovative and novel methods to discover more about the central principle of self-assembly.</p>

				<p>In order to gain any further understanding of the process of organisation at a biomolecular scale, we have chosen to characterise the construction of the HIV capsid. However, whilst accessing and expressing wild type CA proteins was within reach, observing their interaction and mechanism of assembly served to be a far more difficult task.</p>

				<p>Ultimately, our project came down to a single question; how do we accurately characterise not just the final product of an assembly process, but also the steps necessary to produce that final construct? To that end, we have developed a method that may be applied to investigation of other self-assembling systems.</p>

				<h3>Our Solution</h3>
				<p>Our solution is to construct the HIV viral capsid artificially using synthetic DNA structures to template the self-assembly of capsid proteins. We can construct arbitrary shapes with DNA origami, and attach proteins at fixed distances with sub-nanometer precision. This allows us to control, manipulate and observe the process of self-assembly on a molecular scale.</p>
				
				<img class="img-fluid" src="/images/oursolution1.png"/>
				
				<p>We were successfully able to develop a methodology that allowed us to conjugate engineered proteins to carefully designed DNA structures. By building the HIV capsid from the ground up, and with control over the variables within each self-assembly experiment, we were able to move towards a comprehensive understanding of this complex assembly phenomenon.</p>
				<p>Our overall solution, that being of artificially reconstructing the HIV capsid outside of the cell, required answers to many smaller questions ranging from protein mutation to kinetic measurements. By considering various idealised experimental designs which would allow us to test particular self-assembly principles, we produced materials capable of answering our various hypothesise and draw conclusions about self-assembly generally. We have also provided the opportunity for others investigating their own self-assembly system to implement our methods.</p>
