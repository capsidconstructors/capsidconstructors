					<h3>The Problem</h3>
				</div>

				<p>Self-assembly is a fundamental principle governing the coordination of component parts to synthesise biological systems. Individual subunits are only able to interact with their immediate neighbours, and yet form complex systems capable of performing emergent functions. We observe self-assembly in nature at every scale including with biomolecules. And yet, for a principle so entwined with the very existence of life, we know very little about it.</p>

				<p>The HIV capsid is one such self-assembling system. The capsid acts as a protein shield, surrounding the viral RNA within. Whilst the three-dimensional fullerene cone looks complicated in structure, it is in fact made up of a single protein; HIV-1 capsid proteins. Thousands of CA proteins interact on the molecular level, first forming hexamer and pentamers, and then assembling into the HIV capsid.</p>

				<img class="img-fluid" src="/images/theproblem-1.png" />

				<p>Individual protein units must contain encoded information leading to the self-assembly of the capsid structure. This information may relate to the interaction between proteins, conformational changes that occur during the self-assembly system, reaction to changes in environmental conditions. However, given that our proteins are a mere 26.6kDa, conventional measuring technologies are insufficient. Instead, we needed to develop innovative and novel methods to discover more about the central principle of self-assembly.</p>

				<p>In order to gain any further understanding of the process of organisation at a biomolecular scale, we have chosen to characterise the construction of the HIV capsid. However, whilst accessing and expressing wild type CA proteins was within reach, observing their interaction and mechanism of assembly served to be a far more difficult task.</p>

				<p>Ultimately, our project came down to a single question; how do we accurately characterise not just the final product of an assembly process, but also the steps necessary to produce that final construct? To that end, we have developed a method that may be applied to investigation of other self-assembling systems.</p>

					<h3>Background</h3>
				</div>
				
				<p>Self-assembly is a powerful theme found throughout all stages of biological life. From the imposing sight of a murmuration of birds, to the incredible way microbes coordinate behaviour to search and obtain nutrients, the principle of spontaneous formation of complex systems from simple sub-units is abundant. We are interested in learning more about the fundamental principle of self-assembly. </p>
				<p>There has been substantial academic interest in the process of self-assembly. Systems such as the bacterial flagellar motor display finely-tuned properties that facilitate movement of simple organisms, despite being constructed from individual subunits with knowledge only of their immediate neighbour.<sup>[1]</sup> Viral capsids self-assemble from individual proteins, creating a shield that protects the genomic material within.</p>
				<p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) contains the HIV viral capsid, a fullerene cone made of individual protein subunits. </p>
				
				<img class="img-fluid" src="/images/background-1.png"/>
				
				<p>The HIV capsid has been the subject of much research in recent years. Attempts to construct the HIV capsid <em>in vitro</em> have not been successful under physiological conditions. Addition of salt to a high concentration results in the formation of tube-like arrays or extended lattice structures.<sup>2</sup> Underlying this difficulty is our failure to fully understand the fundamental principle of self-assembly. In particular, due to the difficulty of controlling protein interactions given their complexity, and the nano-meter scale on which the proteins self-assembly, the problem of capsid formation is of particular interest.</p>

					<h3>Our Solution</h3>
				</div>

				<p>Our solution is to construct the HIV viral capsid artificially using synthetic DNA structures to template the self-assembly of capsid proteins. We can construct arbitrary shapes with DNA origami, and attach proteins at fixed distances with sub-nanometer precision. This allows us to control, manipulate and observe the process of self-assembly on a molecular scale.</p>

				<img class="img-fluid span" src="/images/oursolution1.png" />

				<p>We were successfully able to develop a methodology that allowed us to conjugate engineered proteins to carefully designed DNA structures. By building the HIV capsid from the ground up, and with control over the variables within each self-assembly experiment, we were able to move towards a comprehensive understanding of this complex assembly phenomenon.</p>
				<p>Our overall solution, that being of artificially reconstructing the HIV capsid outside of the cell, required answers to many smaller questions ranging from protein mutation to kinetic measurements. By considering various idealised experimental designs which would allow us to test particular self-assembly principles, we produced materials capable of answering our various hypothesise and draw conclusions about self-assembly generally. We have also provided the opportunity for others investigating their own self-assembly system to implement our methods.</p>

					<h3>Goals</h3>
				</div>
				
				<p>The goal of our project is to artificially construct the HIV capsid using synthetic DNA templates. However, in order to make our project feasible and achievable for BIOMOD we have had to focus on a few core goals that demonstrate key points in the construction of a full HIV capsid fullerene cone.</p>
				
				<p>We aim to produce a modular DNA origami structure capable of binding HIV capsid protein via multiple, tunable conjugation chemistries. To model the formation of the HIV capsid we have chosen to focus on key capsid components, the hexamer and to a lesser extent the pentamer capsid protein structures. These hexamer and pentamer proteins form the key building blocks of the HIV capsid and so understanding how they form and interact with each other is critical to understanding HIV capsid formation. </p>
